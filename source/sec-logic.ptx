        <title>Introduction to Logic and Propositions</title>
         <p>
         In this module, you will learn about truth values, propositions, logic 
         tables, and lastly proofs. In higher math courses, logic and proofs are 
         used all the time to explain mathematical realtionships; for example, 
         proofs are used to show whether a number is even, odd, prime, or divisible.
         </p>

         <p>
         In this activity, you will start off by learning the basics 
         surrounding propositions, truth values, and logic tables. Attached below
         are guided notes and a video to get you started on your journey to 
         start solving mathematical proofs.

         <introduction>
          <p>
          Now we provide you with a few mysteries to solve using the logic tools from above.
          "Who ate the donut?" has an interactive app that will walk you
          through how to solve the mystery. In "Alligator's Missing Pen", you will solve the mystery by
          a more hands on approach by writing a proof to solve the mystery. Solution videos are 
          available for the first two activities if you happen to get stuck.

           Someone ate the last donut in the box that was supposed to be split among Bird, Fox, and Panda. All
           three are suspects.

         Now you are ready for "Who won the raffle?" proof activity.
         This activity will use everything you've learned so far in this module.
         Feel free to rewatch the videos, review the example problem, or 
         reference your notes while trying to solve the problem. Also, working 
         with others students on this activity is encouraged but not required. You can solve the mystery 
         by using the "Who won the raffle?"" interactive app or by writing a proof for the mystery, similar to 
         "Alligator's Missing Pen".
         Goodluck on solving the mystery!

          <title>Who won the raffle?</title>
           <statement>
            <p> 
            An owl, toad, and raccoon bought raffle tickets. Later they gathered to watch the raffle number 
            drawings. However, the lights went out during the party, and one of the animals tripped into the other 
            animals causing them to all fall to the ground with their raffle tickets. When the power came back on, 
            they found out one of the raffle tickets was the grand-prize winner, but they did not know who bought 
            it.
