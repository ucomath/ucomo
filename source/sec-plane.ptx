           <p>
           Each of the videos below walks you through the steps in making a different
           type of paper airplane pictured below. The only thing that you will need for your 
           airplanes is paper (copy, notebook, or construction 
           paper will work). Although paper is the only material required, something to help crease 
           down folds might also be useful, like a coin, ruler, or pen/pencil; also tape 
           would help secure your planes' wings.

              You can also make your paper airplanes out of alternative 
              materials such as napkins; use whatever you have on hand!

           <p>
           Once you have all your 
           supplies, watch the videos. Feel free to watch at the speed you are most 
           comfortable with (faster or slower), pausing and replaying whenever you need. 
           And, don't forget to have fun!
           </p>

            <note>
             It might be interesting to see how each design performs depending on the paper 
             material used. This is something you can play around with in the Paper Airplane 
             Log.

        <title>Paper Airplane Log Instructions</title>
         <p>
         Mathematicians and scientists conduct experiments to test their hypotheses. 
         These hypotheses are created to ask questions about the world around them. 
         Using the Paper Airplane Log below, you will be conducting your own experiment 
         to find the best paper airplane design out of the 8 provided.
         </p>

         <p>
         Once you have successfully folded multiple airplanes of each design, you will fly 
         them and record your findings. As with any experiment, there are tons of variables 
         that can be measured, each of which will contribute to the design's title as "best". 
         And, like other experiments, multiple attempts must be done to ensure that your results 
         are accurate. So, start by making 3 paper airplanes for each design. Once you have done 
         this, read through the log to get a feel for what should be measured in every test.

        <p>
        The Paper Airplane Log asks that you measure the plane's 
        distance from a target as well as the distance from your plane 
        flown in Round 1. In both of these cases, try to aim your airplane 
        in the same spot each time. The closer your planes are to this spot 
        (the target), the more accurate this design is. The closer your 
        planes are from each other (i.e. small distances measured from where the 
        plane from Round 1 landed), the more precise this design is. 
        </p>

         <note>
         If your idea of a perfect airplane is one that hits its target in 
         the center every time, then precision and accuracy are the 
         characteristics you are looking for.

          Pull up your phone's stopwatch; get a friend to count out loud; have a parent/guardian 
          measure the distance with a ruler or yardstick; put up trashcans and blankets as targets. 
          Get creative! Whatever, and however, you chose to measure when flying your paper airplanes 
          is up to you. Remember that the objective of your experiment is to find the best paper 
          airplane design, so figure out what you think makes a paper airplane the best 
          (fastest, furthest flying, most accurate/precise) and test for that.
