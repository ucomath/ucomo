      <title>The Dirt Problem</title>
<introduction>
<p>Life is a word problem. Usually, in class, word problems are written with a particular topic in mind, and usually give you everything you need to know in order to solve the problem.  Sometimes in life, however, we just need to figure it out. The original inspiration for this problem was found online, but that reference no longer exists.
<ul>
<title>Objectives</title>
<li><p>Determine how much topsoil is necessary to cover a yard.
</p></li>
<li><p>Determine how many truck loads full of topsoil are needed to cover the yard in topsoil.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine what information is necessary to address the first two objectives.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>

         Sam has decided to remove all the old grass from the yard, bring in a new 4 inch layer of topsoil, install an irrigation system, and reseed the lawn. Sam has decided to haul the topsoil from the store, as opposed to paying for delivery. An image of Samâ€™s yard is given below. Sam needs to know how much dirt is needed and how many truck loads full of topsoil will be necessary.
