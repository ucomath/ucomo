<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>The rate at which air temperature decreases with altitude is called the lapse rate. In the troposphere, the layer of atmosphere that extends from the Earthâ€™s surface to a height of about \(7\) miles, the lapse rate is about \(3.6\degree\)F for every \(1000\) feet. (Source: Ahrens, 1998)</p>

<li><p>If the temperature on the ground is \(62\degree\)F, write an equation for the temperature, \(T\text{,}\) at an altitude of \(h\) feet.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the temperature outside an aircraft flying at an altitude of \(30,000\) feet? How much colder is that than the ground temperature?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the temperature at the top of the troposphere?</p></li>
